1. The Analysis Phase in Software Development
1.1 Definition and Importance

The Analysis Phase is a stage in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where business needs are examined, requirements are gathered, and a clear understanding of the system’s functional and non-functional expectations is established.

Importance

Ensures developers and stakeholders share the same understanding.

Reduces rework by clarifying requirements early.

Provides the foundation for design, development, and testing.

Identifies constraints, risks, and dependencies before implementation begins.

1.2 Sub-Steps of the Analysis Phase
1.2.1 Requirement Elicitation

Collecting raw requirements from stakeholders using:

Interviews

Surveys

Observation

Workshops

Document review

1.2.2 Requirement Analysis

Organizing and analyzing gathered information to:

Identify conflicts or inconsistencies

Prioritize business needs

Clarify ambiguous statements

Separate functional from non-functional requirements

1.2.3 Requirement Specification

Documenting validated requirements in clear and formal artifacts such as:

SRS (Software Requirements Specification)

Use cases

User stories (Agile)

Process models (DFDs, BPMN)

1.2.4 Requirement Validation

Ensuring requirements meet quality attributes:

Complete

Consistent

Feasible

Testable

Traceable

Performed through:

Reviews

Walkthroughs

Prototyping

1.3 Deliverables and Outcomes

Key outputs include:

Documents

SRS document

Functional specification

Non-functional specification

Use case diagrams / user stories

Process flows and models

Outcomes

Agreement on what will be built

Prioritized business needs

Clear acceptance criteria

Defined scope

1.4 Best Practices & Common Challenges
Best Practices

Engage all relevant stakeholders early

Use diagrams to visualize processes

Maintain a requirements traceability matrix

Validate continuously

Keep requirements simple and testable

Common Challenges

Ambiguous or changing requirements

Lack of stakeholder involvement

Miscommunication between teams

Overly complicated requirement documents

Scope creep
